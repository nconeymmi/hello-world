# hello-world

To anyone reading this,

This is the start of my journey in creating programs/web pages using PHP, for now. By this time, I know and am capable of using C#, Visual Basic, MySQL, and a bit of PHP, HTML, CSS, and Javascript in my code. 

I've got a lot to learn, and I'm not the best at alotting time for programming--mostly because I tend to procrastinate, a lot. Although I can think of a ton of qualities I'd rather not have, I just can't help but feel extremely excited for learning and trying new things to integrate into my code. I've never felt this sense of creativeness, imagination, adventure, and curiosity my entire life; the kind of feeling most people experience only as a kid.

I hope that I won't lose this feeling, but I also understand that life is like an open flame, constantly being blown by a stream of wind. 

Sometimes the wind may feel like a gust, or even something like a hurricane, heavily blowing the embers of your life away until its the size of a flame out of a tiny little zippo lighter, remember to keep your fire alight as after even the greatest of storms, there is a calm. Know that a blaze spreads with every gust of wind, so harness its current, and you'll surely glow ever more brighter.
